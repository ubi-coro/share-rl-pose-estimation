# share-rl

`share-rl` is a LeRobot extension for structured manipulation workflows.

The repository adds four main things on top of LeRobot:

- new robot and teleoperator integrations, packaged as sibling installable Python projects
- task-frame manipulation primitives and manipulation-primitive nets (MP-Nets) for graph-structured behavior
- recording, training, and offline evaluation helpers around those MP-Nets
- a local-first workspace/runtime layer for editing and reasoning about MP-Nets programmatically

This README is written for someone who wants to use the repo, understand what is installable, and see the intended MP-Net usage pattern.

## What You Get

From the root `share-rl` package itself you get:

- `share.envs.manipulation_primitive`: a single manipulation primitive environment with task-frame constraints, processor pipelines, and intervention logic
- `share.envs.manipulation_primitive_net`: a graph of primitives plus transitions, start/reset semantics, and MP-Net validation
- `share.workspace.mpnet`: helpers to create, save, load, validate, summarize, and edit MP-Net configs
- `share.scripts.record`: record datasets from MP-Nets with per-primitive datasets and optional per-primitive policies
- `share.scripts.train`: thin adapter for training policies on recorded datasets
- `share.scripts.eval_on_dataset`: lightweight offline evaluation/summary adapter for recorded primitive datasets

From the sibling standalone packages in this repo you can also get:

- `lerobot_robot_ur`: UR e-series integration
- `lerobot_robot_viperx`: Trossen ViperX integration
- `lerobot_teleoperator_delta_keyboard`: keyboard delta-velocity teleoperation
- `lerobot_teleoperator_spacemouse`: SpaceMouse teleoperation
- `lerobot_teleoperator_widowx`: WidowX leader-arm style teleoperation

Those sibling packages are installed through the root extras when you install from this repo checkout.

## Current Status

What is already useful:

- MP-Net config objects, transitions, serialization, and validation
- manipulation-primitive processor stack
- UR, ViperX, keyboard, SpaceMouse, and WidowX integration code
- dataset recording, training adapter, and dataset-summary evaluation adapter

What is still more experimental:

- some policy code under `src/share/policies`
- the broader workspace/agent tooling under `src/share/workspace`
- packaging polish for publishing the sibling subprojects independently outside this monorepo checkout

## Installation

The repository currently targets Python 3.10+ and LeRobot `>=0.5`.

A typical local setup is:

```bash
conda create -n share python=3.12
conda activate share
pip install -e .
```

### Optional extras

These extras are designed for use from this repository checkout.

```bash
pip install -e .[ur]
pip install -e .[spacemouse]
pip install -e .[aloha]
pip install -e .[all]
```

What each extra does:

- `.[ur]`: installs the root `share` package plus the sibling `lerobot_robot_ur` project from `src/share/robots/ur`
- `.[spacemouse]`: installs the root `share` package plus the sibling `lerobot_teleoperator_spacemouse` project from `src/share/teleoperators/spacemouse`
- `.[aloha]`: installs the root `share` package plus the sibling `lerobot_robot_viperx` and `lerobot_teleoperator_widowx` projects
- `.[all]`: installs the three hardware extras above plus test dependencies

If you want one sibling package directly, you can also install it by path:

```bash
pip install -e src/share/robots/ur
pip install -e src/share/teleoperators/spacemouse
```

## Installed Commands

The root package currently exposes:

- `share-record`
- `share-train`
- `share-eval`

The root `pyproject.toml` also declares `share-workspace`, but this checkout currently does not contain the `share.scripts.robot_workspace` wrapper module. The workspace functionality is present as Python modules under `share.workspace`, but that CLI wrapper is currently in flux.

## Core Concepts

### Manipulation primitive

A manipulation primitive is one locally coherent behavior with:

- one or more task frames
- processor settings
- an optional policy
- optional notes and task description
- an `is_terminal` flag

### Task frame

A `TaskFrame` defines the control contract for one robot inside a primitive:

- target pose or joint target
- command space: `TASK` or `JOINT`
- per-axis control mode: `POS`, `VEL`, or `WRENCH`
- per-axis policy mode: `ABSOLUTE`, `RELATIVE`, or `None`
- gains and min/max bounds

Only axes whose `policy_mode` is not `None` are learnable by a policy.

### MP-Net

A manipulation-primitive net is a directed graph with:

- `start_primitive`
- `reset_primitive`
- a dictionary of named primitives
- a list of transitions between primitives

The config validates several invariants for you, including:

- transition sources and targets must exist
- non-terminal primitives must have outgoing edges
- terminal primitives must be reachable from `start_primitive`

## Minimal MP-Net Example

This is a small, faithful example of the intended usage pattern: define primitives, define transitions, then save the config as JSON.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from share.envs.manipulation_primitive.config_manipulation_primitive import ManipulationPrimitiveConfig
from share.envs.manipulation_primitive.task_frame import ControlMode, PolicyMode, TaskFrame
from share.envs.manipulation_primitive_net.config_manipulation_primitive_net import ManipulationPrimitiveNetConfig
from share.envs.manipulation_primitive_net.transitions import OnSuccess
from share.utils.constants import DEFAULT_ROBOT_NAME
from share.workspace.mpnet import save_mpnet_config, summarize_mpnet

approach = ManipulationPrimitiveConfig(
    task_frame={
        DEFAULT_ROBOT_NAME: TaskFrame(
            target=[0.0, 0.0, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            control_mode=[ControlMode.POS] * 6,
            policy_mode=[PolicyMode.RELATIVE, PolicyMode.RELATIVE, PolicyMode.RELATIVE, None, None, None],
            min_pose=[-0.10, -0.10, 0.05, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5],
            max_pose=[0.10, 0.10, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
        )
    },
    notes="Approach the object from above.",
    task_description="approach object",
    is_terminal=False,
)

close_gripper = ManipulationPrimitiveConfig(
    task_frame={
        DEFAULT_ROBOT_NAME: TaskFrame(
            target=[0.0, 0.0, 0.10, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            control_mode=[ControlMode.POS] * 6,
            policy_mode=[None] * 6,
        )
    },
    notes="Close and settle.",
    task_description="close gripper",
    is_terminal=True,
)

mpnet = ManipulationPrimitiveNetConfig(
    start_primitive="approach",
    reset_primitive="approach",
    fps=10,
    robot=None,
    teleop=None,
    primitives={
        "approach": approach,
        "close_gripper": close_gripper,
    },
    transitions=[
        OnSuccess(source="approach", target="close_gripper", additional_reward=1.0),
    ],
)

summary = summarize_mpnet(mpnet)
print(summary["primitives"])

save_mpnet_config(mpnet, Path("mpnets/pick.json"))
```

The key pattern is:

1. define a `TaskFrame` for each robot involved in a primitive
2. wrap those task frames in a `ManipulationPrimitiveConfig`
3. connect primitives with explicit transition objects
4. build a `ManipulationPrimitiveNetConfig`
5. save it as JSON with `save_mpnet_config`

If you want a one-node starter template instead, use:

```python
from share.workspace.mpnet import create_template_mpnet, save_mpnet_config

config = create_template_mpnet("main")
save_mpnet_config(config, "mpnets/template.json")
```

## Using the Runtime Pieces

### Recording

`share-record` runs an MP-Net environment, routes teleop/policy actions through the processor stack, and writes one dataset per adaptive primitive.

At a high level it:

- builds a `ManipulationPrimitiveNet`
- creates one dataset per adaptive primitive
- optionally loads one policy per adaptive primitive
- steps the active primitive
- stores transitions in the corresponding primitive dataset

### Training

`share-train` is a thin adapter around LeRobot training. It builds a train config from a policy checkpoint and a dataset location, then delegates to LeRobot’s training entrypoint.

### Evaluation

`share-eval` is a lightweight dataset-summary pass. It reads recorded primitive datasets and emits a compact summary JSON with counts and available metadata.

## Typical Package Imports

Single-robot usage usually touches:

```python
from share.envs.manipulation_primitive.task_frame import TaskFrame, ControlMode, PolicyMode
from share.envs.manipulation_primitive.config_manipulation_primitive import ManipulationPrimitiveConfig
from share.envs.manipulation_primitive_net.config_manipulation_primitive_net import ManipulationPrimitiveNetConfig
```

If you are using local hardware integrations from this repo checkout, common imports are:

```python
from share.robots.ur import URConfig, UR
from share.teleoperators.delta_keyboard import KeyboardVelocityTeleopConfig, KeyboardVelocityTeleop
```

And if you want the standalone LeRobot-style sibling package imports after installing the corresponding extras:

```python
from lerobot_robot_ur import URConfig, UR
from lerobot_teleoperator_spacemouse import SpacemouseConfig, SpaceMouse
```

## Repository Layout

- `src/share/envs`: manipulation primitives, MP-Nets, task frames, transitions
- `src/share/processor`: observation/action/info processing steps used by the env stack
- `src/share/workspace`: MP-Net persistence, summaries, structured editing helpers, and agent/runtime building blocks
- `src/share/scripts`: recording, training, and evaluation entrypoints
- `src/share/robots`: sibling installable robot packages plus `share` namespace facades
- `src/share/teleoperators`: sibling installable teleoperator packages plus `share` namespace facades
- `tests`: release-readiness, env, policy, and workspace tests

## Important Caveats

- The extras in the root package currently use local sibling-package references. They are ideal for working from this monorepo checkout, but they are not yet the final pattern you would want for publishing all pieces independently on PyPI.
- Some of the sibling standalone packages still import `share.*` internals. That is fine when you install from this repository, but it means the subprojects are not fully decoupled yet.
- The workspace/runtime code is present and useful as a library, but the CLI packaging around it is still being stabilized.
